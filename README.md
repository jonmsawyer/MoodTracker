# MoodTracker
#Minimum Viable Product at the moment.

'''
Dependencies:

 1.Python 3.6 or above I am using 3.6.10
 2.PySimpleGUI
 3.Matplotlib
 4.Numpy
 5.Eventually NLTK
 
 What does it do:
 
 The current version posted is designed to work as a mood tracker for bipolar II illness. The survey writes a csv file to whatever path
 you want to choose, just update the path accordingly. 
 
 Plot uses matplotlib to create a scatter plot based on survey responses.
 
 Print Report creates a report of percentages of time spend in each mood state and a list of symtoms: number of times checked over a given
 time range that the user inputs. This function only works in an interpreter for the moment but it will eventually output a report to a
 txt file with all of the above information.
 
 I don't know what the licensing and whatnot is. Please do not try to sell this software. It is designed to help people in the unenviable
 position of undergoing treatment for bipolar disorder and is designed to be free and customizeable to those individuals. Thank you.
